shortcomings: None

compilation: use the latest version of python 3.

Anything else:
- What did we defend agasint
    - Pretty sure we defended against input file direction as we've eliminated any '/' or '\'
    - Overflow errors
    - That all input needs to be correct.

Note:
    - when running the file main.py and you get to the input and output section,
      make sure that the inputted and outputted txt files exist within your directory.
    - input.txt and output.txt is given.
